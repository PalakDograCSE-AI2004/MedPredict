# Health Disease Prediction System

# Introduction

The Health Disease Prediction System is a machine learning-based application that helps users predict the likelihood of having diabetes, heart disease, or Parkinson's disease. By leveraging advanced machine learning models, this platform provides a quick and efficient way to assess health risks based on user input data.

## Overview

This inter-platform application enables users to check if they are likely to be infected with any of the three diseases. It integrates three machine learning models to provide a comprehensive and user-friendly experience. The datasets for training the models were sourced from Kaggle, containing data from various individuals indicating whether they are infected or not.
## Prediction Capabilities

1) Diabetes Prediction
2) Heart Disease Prediction
3) Parkinson's Disease Detection
## Datasets

The datasets for all three models were sourced from Kaggle. They include data from various individuals, indicating whether they are infected or not.
## Workflow

1) Load the Dataset
2) Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3) Train-Test Split the Data
4) Train the Machine Learning Model
5) Make Final Predictions
## Machine Learning Models

1) Heart Disease Prediction: Logistic Regression
2) Diabetes Prediction: Support Vector Machine (SVM)
3) Parkinson's Disease Detection: Support Vector Machine (SVM)
